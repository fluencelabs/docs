# Use Cases

Fluence is useful for all types of applications currently living in the cloud such as web applications, distributed backends, communication software, and IoT. Fluence facilitates building any decentralized application that prioritizes user data privacy, composability, and resilience.

## P2P Apps

Fluence enables resilient and censorship-resistant applications, which may not rely on any intermediary servers and run completely on users' devices. The next generation of truly P2P applications is possible with the Fluence stack.

- Messengers
- Social networks
- Audio and video calls
- Streaming

## Decentralized Protocols

Fluence makes it super easy to build and combine network protocols of any complexity, topology, and scale, using a common [Aqua language](../aqua-book/introduction.md), specifically designed for p2p programming.

- Messaging protocols
- Consensus engines
- Decentralized governance
- File sharing
- Multi-party computation
- Blockchain oracles

## Community-run Applications

With Fluence, applications could be hosted and fully managed without central admin. Community members may run Fluence nodes with the application backends and coordinate via the incentive model they choose (governance token, DAO, etc). Redundancy and load balancing are programmed using the Aqua language and driven by incentives.

- DAO-managed applications  
- Social media platforms  
- Creator economy

## Computations on Decentralized Data

Apps can enable dynamic updates and computation for data they keep in decentralized content-addressable storage. Fluence [supports IPFS](../aqua-book/libraries/aqua-ipfs.md), and other projects are being constantly added.

- Decentralized apps
- Mutable/dynamic NFTs

## Cloud-native Computing

Cloud-native applications may use Fluence to manage microservice backends without reliance on a central coordination server. The Fluence programming model allows upgrading applications and implementing new business logic without re-deploying microservices. Content addressable functions and services make backwards compatibility seamless, so things just do not break when a service is updated to a new version.

- Distributed microservice orchestration
- Distributed SaaS
- Serverless

## Blockchain Infrastructure

Cryptocurrency exchanges, multi-sig wallets, DAO management tools may use Fluence to optimize gas costs by moving signed transactions, order books off-chain while keeping on-chain trade settlement.

- Cryptocurrency exchanges
- Wallets
- DAO tools
- Cross-chain tools

## Unstoppable API and Composition

As Fluence enables content-addressable code, services and functions can be permanently accessed over the network while hosted by at least a single node. This brings the new paradigm of composing APIs, which is much easier and faster than re-building and re-hosting similar micro-services in the cloud for every new app.
