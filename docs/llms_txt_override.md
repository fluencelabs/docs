# Fluence Docs

> Fluence is a decentralized compute network for deploying virtual machines on globally distributed, independently operated infrastructure. Built on an Arbitrum Orbit L2 appchain anchored to Ethereum, Fluence coordinates compute providers through staking and governance. Compute is paid in USDC; FLT is the native token used for staking and protocol governance.

## Get started

Choose a section based on how you use Fluence:

- **[Build](https://fluence.dev/docs/build/llms.txt)** — Rent CPU and GPU instances from the decentralized compute marketplace using the Fluence Console or API.
- **[Stake](https://fluence.dev/docs/stake/llms.txt)** — Delegate FLT tokens to secure the network and earn rewards.
- **[Connect Servers](https://fluence.dev/docs/connect_servers/llms.txt)** — Register your data center hardware as a compute provider and earn USDC and FLT.
- **[Build with AI](https://fluence.dev/docs/build_with_ai/overview.md)** — How to use Fluence docs with LLMs, AI coding assistants, and agent frameworks.

Each section links to an llms.txt index with links to individual documentation pages in markdown format.
