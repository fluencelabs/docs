# Installation

To work with Aqua code from command line, install [Fluence CLI](https://github.com/fluencelabs/cli) and use [`fluence aqua`](https://github.com/fluencelabs/cli/blob/main/docs/commands/README.md#fluence-aqua) subcommand.

Also, the compiler API is exposed as an npm package, see [Aqua JS API](../../aqua-js-api.md).

Moreover, a VSCode syntax-highlighting extension is available. In VSCode, click on the Extensions button, search for `aqua` and install the extension.
