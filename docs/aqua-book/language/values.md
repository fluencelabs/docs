# Values

Aqua is all about combining data and computations. The runtime for the compiled Aqua code, [AquaVM](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aquavm), tracks what data comes from what origin, which constitutes the foundation for distributed systems security. That approach, driven by Ï€-calculus and security considerations of open-by-default networks and distributed applications as custom application protocols, also puts constraints on the language that configures it.

Values in Aqua are backed by VDS (Verifiable Data Structures) in the runtime. All operations on values must keep the authenticity of data, proved by signatures under the hood.

That's why values are immutable. Changing the value effectively makes a new one:

```aqua
x = "hello"
y = "world"

-- despite the sources of x and y, z's origin is "peer 1"
-- and we can trust value of z as much as we trust "peer 1"
on "peer 1":
  z <- concat(x, y)
```

More on that in the Security section. Now let's see how we can work with values inside the language.

## Arguments

Function arguments are available within the whole function body.

```aqua
func foo(arg: i32, log: string -> ()):
  -- Use data arguments
  bar(arg)

  -- Arguments can have arrow type and be used as strings
  log("Wrote arg to responses")
```

## Return values

You can assign the results of an arrow call to a name and use this returned value in the code below.

```aqua
-- Imagine a Stringify service that's always available
service Stringify("stringify"):
  i32ToStr(arg: i32) -> string

-- Define the result type of a function
func bar(arg: i32) -> string:
  -- Make a value, name it x
  x <- Stringify.i32ToStr(arg)
  -- Starting from there, you can use x
  -- Pass x out of the function scope as the return value
  <- x


func foo(arg: i32, log: *string):
  -- Use bar to convert arg to string, push that string
  -- to logs stream, return nothing
  log <- bar(arg)
```

Aqua functions may return more than one value.

```aqua
-- Define return types as a comma separated list
func myFunc() -> bool, string:
  -- Function must return values for all defined types
  <- true, "successful execution"
  
func otherFunc():
  -- Call a function, don't use returns
  myFunc()  
  -- Get any number of results out of the function
  flag <- myFunc()
  
  -- Push results to a stream
  results: *string
  is_ok, results <- myFunc()
  if is_ok:
    -- We know that it contains successful result
    foo(results!)
```

## Literals

Aqua supports just a few literals: numbers, double-quoted strings, booleans and `nil`.

```aqua
-- String literals cannot contain double quotes
-- No single-quoted strings allowed, no escape chars.
foo("double quoted string literal")

-- Booleans are true or false
if x == false:
  foo("false is a literal")

-- Numbers are different
-- Any number:
bar(1)  

-- Signed number:
bar(-1)

-- Float:
bar(-0.2)

func takesMaybe(arg: ?string): ...

-- nil can be passed in every place
-- where a read-only collection fits
takesMaybe(nil)
```

## Arithmetic operators

Aqua supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (power), `%` (reminder) for integer values.

```aqua
func arithmetics(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32:
  c = a + b
  d = c - a
  e = d * c
  f = e / d
  -- power 3: unsigned number expected
  g = f ** 3
  -- remainder
  e = g % f
  
  -- It is possible to use arithmetics
  -- anywhere an integer is required
  <- a + (b - c) + d * (e - 6)
```

Precedence of operators from highest to lowest:
- `**`
- `*`, `/`, `%` (left associative)
- `+`, `-` (left associative)

## Comparison operators

Aqua supports `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` for integer values.
Result of a comparison operator has type `bool`.

```aqua
func comparison(a: i32, b: i32) -> bool:
    c = a < b
    d = a > b
    e = a <= b
    f = a >= b

    <- f
```

Comparison operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators.

```aqua
-- This is equivalent to (a + b) < (c * d)
v = a + b < c * d
```

## Equality operators

Aqua supports `==`, `!=` for [scalars](types.md#scalars), [collections](types.md#collections), and [structures](types.md#structures).
Result of an equality operator has type `bool`.

```aqua
func equality(a: i32, b: i32) -> bool:
    c = a == b
    d = a != b

    <- d
```

Equality operators have lower precedence than comparison operators.

```aqua
-- This is equivalent to ((a + b) < c) == (d >= (e * f))
v = a + b < c == d >= e * f
```

## Logical operators

Aqua supports `!`, `||`, `&&` for boolean values.
Result of a logical operator has type `bool`.

```aqua
func logic(a: bool, b: bool) -> bool:
    c = !a
    d = a || b
    e = a && b

    <- (e || c) && d || !!true
```

Precedence of operators from highest to lowest:
- `!`
- `&&`
- `||`

Logical operators have lower precedence than equality operators.

```aqua
-- This is equivalent to (((a + b) >= c) && ((d * e) < f)) || (g != h)
v = a + b >= c && d * e < f || g != h
```

:::caution
Operators `||` and `&&` are short-circuiting, so the right operand is evaluated 
only if the left operand does not determine the result.

```aqua
service Launcher("launcher"):
    launch(what: string) -> bool

func foo() -> bool:
    check = 1 < 2
    -- Launcher.launch won't be called!
    res = check || Launcher.launch("rockets")
    <- res
```

## Collections

With Aqua it is possible to create a [stream](crdt-streams.md), fill it with values, and use in place of any collection:

```aqua
-- foo returns an array
func foo() -> []string:
  -- Initiate a typed stream
  ret: *string
  
  -- Push values into the stream
  ret <<- "first"
  ret <<- "second"
  
  -- Return the stream in place of the array
  <- ret
```

Aqua provides syntax sugar for creating any of the collection types with `[ ... ]` for arrays, `?[ ... ]` for optional values, `*[ ... ]` for streams.

```aqua
func foo() -> []string, ?bool, *u32:
  <- ["string1", "string2"], ?[true, false], *[1, 3, 5]
```

The `?[]` expression takes any number of arguments, but returns an optional value that contains no more than one value. This is done by trying to yield these values one by one. The first value that yields without an error will be added to the resulting option.

```aqua
func getFlag(maybeFlagA: ?bool, maybeFlagB: ?bool, default: bool) -> bool:
  res = ?[maybeFlagA!, maybeFlagB!, default]
  <- res!
```

The length of a collection can be obtained using the `.length` command.

```aqua
func getLength(arr: []string) -> u32:
  <- arr.length
```

It is not possible yet to get an element by index or get a length directly from the collection creation expression, e.g. `?[maybe!].length`, `[1, 2, 3][index]` are not allowed.

It is possible to fill any [immutable collection](./types.md#immutable-collections) with an empty one using `nil`.

```aqua
func empty() -> []string, ?bool:
  <- nil, nil
```

## Getters

In Aqua, you can use a getter to peek into a field of a product or indexed element in an array.

```aqua
data Sub:
  sub: string

data Example:
  field: u32
  arr: []Sub
  child: Sub

func foo(e: Example):
  bar(e.field) -- u32
  bar(e.child) -- Sub
  bar(e.child.sub) -- string
  bar(e.arr) -- []Sub
  bar(e.arr!) -- gets the 0 element
  bar(e.arr!.sub) -- string
  bar(e.arr!2) -- gets the 2nd element
  bar(e.arr!2.sub) -- string
  bar(e.arr[2]) -- gets the 2nd element
  bar(e.arr[2].sub) -- string
  bar(e.arr[e.field]) -- can use any scalar as index with [] syntax
```

Note that the `!` operator may fail or halt:

* If it is called on an immutable collection, it will fail if the collection is shorter and has no given index; you can handle the error with [try](../language/flow/conditional.md#try) or [otherwise](../language/flow/conditional.md#otherwise).
* If it is called on an appendable stream, it will wait for some parallel append operation to fulfill, see [Join behavior](../language/flow/parallel.md#join-behavior).

:::caution
The `!` operator can currently only be used with literal indices.

That is, `!2` is valid but `!x` is not valid.

To access an index with non-literal, use the brackets index: `[x]`.
:::

## Assignments

Assignments (`=`) could be used to give an alias to the result of an expression (e.g. literal, applied getter, math expression).

```aqua
func foo(arg: bool, e: Example):
  -- Rename the argument
  a = arg
  -- Assign the name b to value of e.child
  b = e.child
  -- Create a named literal
  c = "just string value"
  -- Assign the name to the result of a multiplication
  d = e.field * 2
```

## Constants

Constants are like assignments but in the root scope. They can be used in all function bodies, textually below the place of const definition. Constant values must resolve to a literal.

You can change the compilation results by overriding a constant but the override needs to be of the same type or subtype.

Constants are always `UPPER_CASE`.

```aqua
-- This FLAG is always true
const FLAG = true

-- This SETTING can be overwritten via CLI flag
const SETTING ?= "value"

func foo(arg: string): ...

func bar():
  -- Type of SETTING is string
  foo(SETTING)
```

## Visibility scopes

Visibility scopes follow the contracts of execution flow.

By default, everything defined textually above is available below. With some exceptions.

Functions have isolated scopes:

```aqua
func foo():
   a = 5

func bar():
   -- a is not defined in this function scope
   a = 7   
   foo() -- a inside fo is 5
```

[For loop](flow/iterative.md#export-data-from-for) does not export anything from it:

```aqua
func foo():
  x = 5
  for y <- ys:
    -- Can use what was defined above
    z <- bar(x)

  -- z is not defined in scope  
  z = 7
```

[Parallel](flow/parallel.md#join-behavior) branches have [no access](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aqua/issues/90) to each other's data:

```aqua
-- This will deadlock, as foo branch of execution will
-- never send x to a parallel bar branch
x <- foo()
par y <- bar(x)

-- After par is executed, all the can be used
baz(x, y)
```

Recovery branches in [conditional flow](../language/flow/conditional.md) have no access to the main branch as the main branch exports values, whereas the recovery branch does not:

```aqua
try:
  x <- foo()
otherwise:
  -- this is not possible â€“ will fail
  bar(x)  
  y <- baz()

-- y is not available below  
willFail(y)
```

## Streams as literals

Stream is a special data structure that allows many writes. It has [a dedicated article](crdt-streams.md).

To use a stream, you need to initiate it at first:

```aqua
-- Initiate an (empty) appendable collection of strings
resp: *string

-- Write strings to resp in parallel
resp <- foo()
par resp <- bar()

for x <- xs:
  -- Write to a stream that's defined above
  resp <- baz()

try:
  resp <- baz()
otherwise:
  on "other peer":
    resp <- baz()

-- Now resp can be used in place of arrays and optional values
-- assume fn: []string -> ()
fn(resp) 

-- Can call fn with empty stream: you can use it
-- to construct empty values of any collection types
nilString: *string
fn(nilString)
```

One of the most frequently used patterns for streams is [Conditional return](flow/conditional.md#conditional-return).

You can create a stream with [Collection creation](values.md#collections) operators.
