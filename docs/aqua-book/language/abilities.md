# Abilities

While [Execution flow](./flow/flow.md) organizes the flow from peer to peer, Abilities & Services describe what exactly can be called on these peers, and how to call it.

Ability is a concept of "what is possible in this context": like a peer-specific trait or a type class. It will be better explained once abilities passing is implemented.
