# Fluence Docs

> Fluence is a decentralized serverless computing platform. It provides a compute marketplace where developers can rent CPU and GPU resources, stakers can delegate FLT tokens to secure the network, and providers can connect their servers to earn rewards.

This file lists the documentation sections available on fluence.dev. Each section has its own llms.txt with links to individual pages in markdown format.
