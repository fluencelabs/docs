# Setting up project

## Install dependencies

Initialize an empty `npm` package:

```sh
npm init
```

In newly created `package.json` file add module entry
```json
{
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

We will need JS-client itself

```sh
npm install @fluencelabs/js-client
```

We will need the Fluence CLI to use the Aqua compiler

> You can find CLI installation guide [here](https://github.com/fluencelabs/cli).

Aqua comes with the standard library, which can be accessed from "@fluencelabs/aqua-lib" package. This package in bundled in Fluence CLI, so you don't need to install anything.

And last, but not least, we need TypeScript:

```sh
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node
```

Create `tsconfig.json` file and add following content there

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "moduleResolution": "nodenext"
  }
}
```

Create a new file called `fluence.yaml` and put there following content:

```yaml
version: 5

aquaInputPath: aqua

aquaOutputTSPath: src/compiled-aqua
```

## Compiling aqua

Create directory `aqua` for storing your aqua files there. You probably want to keep the generated TypeScript in the same directory with other typescript files, usually `src`. Let's create the `src/compiled-aqua` directory for that.

Imagine we have `hello-world.aqua` file which we want to compile. The example project structure would look like this:

```
 ┣ aqua
 ┃ ┗ hello-world.aqua
 ┣ src
 ┃ ┣ compiled-aqua
 ┃ ┃ ┗ hello-world.ts
 ┃ ┗ index.ts
 ┃ fluence.yaml
 ┣ package-lock.json
 ┣ package.json
 ┗ tsconfig.json
```

To compile Aqua, we can use the Fluence CLI with `npm`:

```sh
npx fluence aqua
```

Using the code generated by the compiler is as easy as calling a function. The compiler generates all the boilerplate needed to send a particle into the network and wraps it into a single call. It also generates a function for service callback registration. Note that all the type information and therefore type checking and code completion facilities are there!
