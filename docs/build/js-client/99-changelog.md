# Changelog

Fluence JS versioning scheme is the following: `0.BREAKING.ENHANCING`

- `0` shows that Fluence JS does not meet its vision yet, so API can change quickly
- `BREAKING` part is incremented for each breaking API change
- `ENHANCING` part is incremented for every fix and update which is compatible on API level

Please note that a little upgrade is required to switch to v0.23.0: https://doc.fluence.dev/docs/fluence-js/4_run_in_browser-1#configuring-application-to-run-in-browser
