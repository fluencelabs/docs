# About

The main points to keep in mind before going further are the following:

- Fluence is about P2P networks
- In Fluence, you write Aqua code
- You can run Aqua code from JS applications
- In order to do this, you need to use the Fluence JS Client
- Basically what the Fluence JS Client does is connecting to a network and allowing you to execute some Aqua code
- The Fluence JS Client comes in two flavours: web and nodejs.

Now you are ready to begin!
