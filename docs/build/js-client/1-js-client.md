# Introduction

In order to interact with peers of a peer-to-peer network, e.g., to execute an Aqua script, the "client" has to be a peer. Such client peers don't have to be publicly accessible or long-running in nature but they need to follow the protocol.  In the Fluence ecosystem, browser, command line or node apps can be built on the [js client](https://github.com/fluencelabs/js-client).

Whatever the (client) use-case, js-client allows you to easily connect your dApp to the Fluence network and execute Aqua scripts without having to deep dive into libp2p programming.
