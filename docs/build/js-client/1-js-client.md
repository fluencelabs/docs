# Introduction

Fluence is a platform that focuses on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, which allows for the creation of decentralized applications. One of the main features of Fluence is the use of Aqua code, which is a programming language that enables developers to write code for the Fluence network.

If you want to run Aqua code from JavaScript (JS) applications, you need to use the Fluence JS Client. This tool is what connects your JS application to the Fluence network, enabling you to execute Aqua code. The Fluence JS Client comes in two flavors: web and nodejs.

The Fluence JS Client web flavor is designed to be used with web applications, while the nodejs flavor is intended for use with Node.js applications. Essentially, the Fluence JS Client acts as a bridge between your JS application and the Fluence network. It allows you to interact with the network and execute code, all while ensuring that your application remains secure and stable.

Using the Fluence JS Client is a straightforward process. Once you have chosen the flavor that best suits your needs, you can simply connect your application to the Fluence network and start executing Aqua code. This makes it easy for developers to create decentralized applications that can run on the Fluence network, helping to deal with the complexities of P2P networks and the security concerns that come with them.

Now you are ready to begin!
