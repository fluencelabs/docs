# Renting an instance

The Fluence marketplace is a decentralized broker of GPU compute supply and demand that facilitates the renting process of GPU instances and management of your instances in datacenters located around the world.
The GPU marketplace offers three kinds of GPU workload for deployments: containers, VMs and bare metal instances. This document is focused on showing how to choose and configure and deploy an instance of any available kind.

## Billing model

GPU instances are billed hourly on a pre-paid model. Each instance has its own dedicated balance that covers ongoing rent.

Billing periods are fixed hourly intervals (e.g., 15:00–16:00, 16:00–17:00 UTC) regardless of when the instance was started. At each billing period, one hour of rent is charged from the instance's balance.

**Deployment charge.** When you deploy an instance, an amount equivalent to 3 hours of rent is deducted from your account balance and transferred to the instance's balance. The current billing period is charged immediately, and the remaining 2 hours serve as a reserve. If provisioning fails, the full amount is returned to your account balance.

**Automatic top-ups.** The system maintains a reserve of 2 hours of rent on each instance's balance. When the reserve drops below this target — typically after each hourly charge — the system automatically tops it up from your account balance.

**Insufficient funds.** If your account balance cannot cover a top-up, the system will keep retrying. Your instance runs through any billing period that has already been paid for. Termination occurs when the system cannot charge for the next billing period due to insufficient funds on the instance's balance — the instance is then automatically deleted.

**Funds after termination.** When an instance stops — whether terminated by you or the system — all unused funds remaining on the instance's balance are returned to your account balance.

You can check the amounts reserved for your running instances on the **Billing** page in the Fluence Console.

## GPU container

GPU containers are lightweight deployments that run containerized workloads with full GPU access. They are ideal for running ML inference, training jobs, or any GPU-accelerated application packaged as a container image.

### 1. Select the GPU model

Choose the GPU model that fits your workload requirements. Each GPU card displays key specifications:

- **vRAM**: GPU memory available
- **Interface**: Connection type (PCIe or SXM — SXM offers higher memory bandwidth for multi-GPU workloads)
- **Price**: Minimum hourly rate in USD across all available configurations for this GPU model

### 4. Set the container image

Choose the container image for your deployment. You have two options:

**Predefined images**: Select from available pre-configured images (e.g., Debian SSH 11) using the dropdown.

**Custom images**: Click **Add Image** to specify your own container image from a registry.

![Set container image](./assets/containers/set_image.webp)

#### Using a custom image

When adding a custom image, a dialog appears with the following options:

- **Image**: Enter the full image reference (e.g., `myorg/myimage:latest`)
- **Private Mode**: Enable this toggle to access private repositories. When enabled, additional fields appear:
  - **Host**: Select the container registry (GitHub Container Registry or Docker Hub)
  - **Username**: Your registry username
  - **Password**: Your registry password or access token

Click **Set image** to confirm your selection.

![Custom image dialog](./assets/containers/set_custom_image.webp)

### 5. Set the container start command

In the **Container Start Command** field, enter the script that will be executed as the entrypoint when the container starts. The script should be written as a bash script. Leave empty to use the default entrypoint defined in the container image.

![Container start command](./assets/containers/start_command.webp)

### 6. Configure ports

Specify which ports should be accessible on your container. Enter port numbers separated by commas. Supported formats:

- Port number only: `22, 443` (defaults to TCP)
- Port with protocol: `8080/tcp`, `53/udp`
- Port ranges: `5000-5005`

Port 22 is included by default for SSH access. Check **Enable http on port 80** to expose HTTP traffic on port 80.

![Configure ports](./assets/containers/ports.webp)

### 7. Set environment variables

Add environment variables that will be available inside your container. Click **Add Variable** and provide:

- **Name**: The variable name (e.g., `MODEL_PATH`)
- **Value**: The variable value (e.g., `/models/llama`)

You can add multiple variables as needed. Click the **X** button to remove a variable.

![Environment variables](./assets/containers/env.webp)

### 8. Select SSH keys

Choose which SSH keys should have access to the container. Your registered keys are displayed, and you can select or deselect them. Click **Add New Key** to register a new SSH key if needed.

:::warning
When using a predefined OS image, the environment variable `SSH_PUBKEY` is reserved by the system for injecting your selected SSH keys into the container. Defining an environment variable with this name will cause the deployment request to fail.

### 9. Review and launch

Review your configuration in the **Review** panel on the right side. Verify:

- Instance name and location
- Selected image
- Hardware configuration (GPU, vRAM, interface, vCPU, RAM, Disk)
- Payment details (hourly rate, upfront payment of 3 hours, total)

Click **Launch** to deploy your GPU container. You will be redirected to the **Instances** page where you can monitor the deployment status.

## VM and Bare Metal

GPU VMs and bare metal instances provide full OS-level access with GPU passthrough. VMs run on a hypervisor, while bare metal gives you a dedicated physical server with no virtualization overhead. Both types share the same creation flow — the only difference is the tab you select at the top of the page (**VM** or **Bare Metal**).

:::info
The steps below apply to both VM and bare metal deployments. The screenshots show the VM tab, but the bare metal flow is identical.
:::

### 1. Select the GPU model

At the top of the page, select the **VM** or **Bare Metal** tab. Then choose the GPU model that fits your workload requirements. Each GPU card displays key specifications:

- **vRAM**: GPU memory available. Some GPU models offer multiple vRAM options — use the dropdown on the card to select the desired variant.
- **Interface**: Connection type (PCIe or SXM). Some GPU models support both — use the dropdown to choose. SXM offers higher memory bandwidth and is typically used for multi-GPU training workloads.
