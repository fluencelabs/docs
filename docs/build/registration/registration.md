## Self-Custodial Wallet

Smart contracts are used to rent and manage resources from the Fluence network, requiring users to use an [EVM wallet](https://blog.thirdweb.com/what-are-evm-wallets/). However, managing externally owned account (EOA) wallets, aka "regular" wallets, comes with certain limitations and pitfalls.

To address these concerns, our system uses a unique Self-Custodial Wallet based on a [solution from Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/docs/how-web3auth-works), which operates on the [MPC](https://web3auth.io/docs/features/mpc) (Multi-Party Computation) protocol, instead of a standard EOA address. Thus, after a user registers through **Fluence Console**, a unique address is generated for them, and only the user has access to the private key. The private key is securely stored in parts within the distributed Web3Auth network and is protected by the MPC protocol. In turn, the Fluence protocol only has access to the userâ€™s public address.
