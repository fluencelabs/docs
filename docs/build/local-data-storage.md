# Local Data Storage

A peer hosting services may agree to provide access to their filesystem or allocate additional RAM. However, such persistence provisioning generally comes with no guarantees of availability. For example, a peer reboot will wipe a SQLite in-memory data base. Moreover, by the very nature of their local provisioning, such data sources are only available through the "sponsoring" service: there is no direct data access and when the service ceases to exist so does the data.While local data persistence has its use cases, developers need to be aware of their limitations.

### Local Filesystem

While Wasm modules in general are sandboxed to not have access to host resources, Marine Wasm modules may be granted access to a variety of host resources iff the host peer agrees to such access. The request for resource access and allocation come in form of deployment parameters, which we'll see very soon

The [accompanying repo](notion://www.notion.so/fluencenetwork/Fluence-Developer-Documentation-bdf8d06ad52e493fb765456dbd5480cd).

Let's start by creating a new, minimal Fluence CLI project by the name of your choice:

```
fluence init write-to-file
? Select template minimal

Successfully initialized Fluence project template at ~/localdev/write-to-file

cd write-to-file

```

In the new project directory, we scaffold a new service:

```
fluence service new
? Enter service path services
? Do you want to use services as the name of your new service? No
? Enter service name (must start with a lowercase letter and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores)
filesys_adapter
Successfully generated template for new service at services
? Do you want add filesys_adapter to fluence.yaml? Yes
    Updating crates.io index

```

Which gives us the project scaffold:

```
tree services -L 4 -I target
services
├── modules
│   ├── filesys_adapter
│   │   ├── Cargo.lock
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   ├── module.yaml
│   │   └── src
│   │       └── main.rs
│   └── use_filesys
│       ├── Cargo.lock
│       ├── Cargo.toml
│       ├── module.yaml
│       └── src
│           └── main.rs
└── service.yaml

```

And the Rust template:

```rust
// services/modules/filesys_adapter/src/main.rs
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
use marine_rs_sdk::marine;
use marine_rs_sdk::module_manifest;

module_manifest!();

pub fn main() {}

#[marine]
pub fn greeting(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hi, {}", name)
}

```

Which we'll have to modify. In addition to the adapter, which handles the access to the local resource, we also want a to add some minimal business logic to use our adapter.

```bash
fluence module new
? Enter service path services
? Do you want to use services as the name of your new service? No
? Enter service name (must start with a lowercase letter and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores) use_filesys
Successfully generated template for new service at services
? Do you want add use_filesys to fluence.yaml? Yes
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.19s
Added use_filesys to fluence.yaml

```

With the scaffolding out of the way, let's code our modules. First, we create our general-purpose, reusable "adapter" module to handle the put/get operations to/from the local, i.e., host peer, filesystem and add a file removal method, `rm`, as well:

```rust
use marine_rs_sdk::marine;

use std::fs;
use std::path::PathBuf;

const SITES_DIR: &str = "/sites/";

pub fn main() {}

#[marine]
pub fn put(name: String, file_content: Vec<u8>) -> String {
    let rpc_tmp_filepath = format!("{}{}", SITES_DIR, name);

    let result = fs::write(PathBuf::from(rpc_tmp_filepath.clone()), file_content);
    if let Err(e) = result {
        return format!("file can't be written: {}", e);
    }

    String::from("Ok")
}

#[marine]
pub fn get(file_name: String) -> Vec<u8> {
    let tmp_filepath = format!("{}{}", SITES_DIR, file_name);
    fs::read(tmp_filepath).unwrap_or_else(|_| b"error while reading file".to_vec())
}

#[marine]
pub fn rm(name: String) -> String {
    let rpc_tmp_filepath = format!("{}{}", SITES_DIR, name);
    let result = fs::remove_file(rpc_tmp_filepath);
    match result {
        Ok(_) => "OK".to_string(),
        Err(e) => e.to_string(),
    }
}```

The code is pretty straight forward read/write but a few lines are noteworthy: The `const SITES_DIR` is the *alias* to the local path and needs to match up with the mapping in `modules.yaml`.

The scaffolded default file looks like this:

```yaml
version: 0
type: rust
name: filesys_adapter

```

Which is not enough. We need to specify that we want this module to be able to access the hosts filesystem via some specified directory and we do this my mounting a named directory mapped to the SITES_DIR alias:

```
//services/modules/filesys_adapter/module.yaml
version: 0
type: rust
name: filesys_adapter
volumes:
  sites: ./tmp

```

For more information on import functions see the [Marine book](/docs/marine-book/marine-runtime/configuration-file) and the [configuration properties](https://github.com/fluencelabs/fluence-cli/tree/main/docs/configs/module.md) provided by Fluence CLI.

With our configuration in place, let's build our adapter:

```bash
# in the project root directory
Fluence build
Making sure all services are downloaded... done
   Compiling filesys_adapter v0.1.0 (/Users/bebo/localdev/write-to-file/services/modules/filesys_adapter)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.40s
Making sure all modules are downloaded and built... done

```

where the *volumes* section contains the mapping of the actual directory to the alias we set as in the  . For more information on configuring Marine modules, see the [Marine book](/docs/marine-book/marine-runtime/configuration-file).

For more effective ways to read/write files, see the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html) and [cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/file/read-write.html) and create your own custom file IO adapter!

Now that we have our [effector module](/docs/marine-book/basic-concepts/) in place, let's code our [facade module](https://fluence.dev/docs/build/glossary.md#facade-module), which in our case consists of simple read and write methods essentially wrapping the effector methods with a little convenience: instead of byte arrays we can use human readable strings to write and read our file content.

Recall that Wasm IT modules are shared nothing and that we need to explicitly link dependencies. Before we code our facade, let's have a look at what we need to do to link our effector, aka adapter, module:

```rust
#[marine]
#[link(wasm_import_module = "filesys_adapter")] // 1
extern "C" {
    #[link_name = "get"]
    pub fn file_get(file_name: String) -> Vec<u8>; // 2

    #[link_name = "put"]
    pub fn file_put(name: String, file_content: Vec<u8>) -> String;
}

```

- (1): here we use [Rust's FFI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html) to specify the module name we want to [import](/docs/marine-book/marine-rust-sdk/developing/import-functions)
- (2): for each (public) method in our effector module, we create a link reference and assign a link name, i.e. *get* or *put*, which are now available to the facade module.

Let's put it all together:

```rust
// services/modules/use_filesys/src/main.rs
use marine_rs_sdk::marine;

pub fn main() {}

#[marine]
pub struct IOResult {
    pub stdout: String,
    pub stderr: String,
}

#[marine]
pub fn read_file(name: String) -> IOResult {
    let response: Vec<u8> = file_get(name);
    if response == b"error while reading file".to_vec() {
        return IOResult {
            stdout: "".to_string(),
            stderr: "error reading file".to_string(),
        };
    } else {
        IOResult {
            stdout: String::from_utf8_lossy(&response).to_string(),
            stderr: "".to_string(),
        }
    }
}

#[marine]
pub fn write_file(name: String, payload: String) -> IOResult {
    let content = payload.as_bytes().to_vec();
    let response = file_put(name, content);

    let result = response.as_str().contains("file can't be written:");
    if result {
        return IOResult {
            stdout: "".to_string(),
            stderr: response,
        };
    } else {
        IOResult {
            stdout: "OK".to_string(),
            stderr: "".to_string(),
        }
    }
}

#[marine]
pub fn rm_file(name: String) -> IOResult {
    let result = file_remove(name);
    if &result == "OK" {
        return IOResult {
            stdout: result,
            stderr: "".to_string(),
        };
    } else {
        IOResult {
            stdout: "".to_string(),
            stderr: result,
        }
    }
}

#[marine]
#[link(wasm_import_module = "filesys_adapter")] // 1
extern "C" {
    #[link_name = "get"]
    pub fn file_get(file_name: String) -> Vec<u8>; // 2

    #[link_name = "put"]
    pub fn file_put(name: String, file_content: Vec<u8>) -> String;

    #[link_name = "rm"]
    pub fn file_remove(name: String) -> String;
}

```

Now that our business logic is in place we can compile our code to the Wasm modules:

```
fluence build
Making sure all services are downloaded... done
    Blocking waiting for file lock on package cache
    <...>
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.20s
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.20s
Making sure all modules are downloaded and built... done

```

All looks good and we now have two Wasm module we'd like to use as a service. See the respective `target\\wasm32-wasi\\release` directories for the *.wasm files.

We have one more step to complete the create a service from our Wasm modules: specify the linking configuration in the `services/services.yaml` file by naming the appropriate facade and linked module(s). Update your *services.yaml* to:

```yaml
version: 0
name: local_storage
modules:
  facade:
    get: modules/use_filesys
  filesys_adapter:
    get: modules/filesys_adapter

```

Now we can use our service, aptly called *local_storage*, even without deployment to the network in the [Marine REPL](https://fluence.dev/docs/marine-book/marine-tooling-reference/marine-repl.md):

```bash
fluence service repl
? Enter service name from fluence.yaml, path to a service or url to .tar.gz archive services

Note you can list the available/exposed interfaces with **i**:

```bash

  fn rm(name: string) -> string
  fn get(file_name: string) -> []u8
use_filesys:
  fn rm_file(name: string) -> IOResult
  fn read_file(name: string) -> IOResult
  fn write_file(name: string, payload: string) -> IOResult

```

Recall, our facade, i.e., entry, API is *use_filesys*. Let's interact with our service by writing a file, reading the file, removing the file and reading the files again:

```bash
2> call use_filesys write_file  ["test-file.txt", "Hello, Fluence!"]
result: Object {"stderr": String(""), "stdout": String("OK")}
 elapsed time: 639.177µs

3> call use_filesys read_file ["test-file.txt"]

4> call use_filesys rm_file ["test-file.txt"]

```

Now that we have our services deployed, we can turn our focus on writing the necessary Aqua code. First, we clear out the template code in the `src/aqua/main.aqua` file and start from scratch:

```python
-- src/aqua.main
aqua Main

import App from "deployed.app.aqua"
-- we get these params from .fluence/aqua/services/use_filesys.aqua
import IOResult, UseFilesys from "services/use_filesys.aqua"
export App, write_to_file, read_from_file, remove_file

func write_to_file(filename: string, content: string) -> IOResult:
    services <- App.services()
    on services.use_filesys.default!.peerId:
        UseFilesys services.use_filesys.default!.serviceId
        res <- UseFilesys.write_file(filename, content)
    <- res

func read_from_file(filename:string) -> IOResult:
    services <- App.services()
    on services.use_filesys.default!.peerId:
        UseFilesys services.use_filesys.default!.serviceId
        res <- UseFilesys.read_file(filename)
    <- res

func remove_file(filename: string) -> IOResult:
    services <- App.services()
    on services.use_filesys.default!.peerId:
        UseFilesys services.use_filesys.default!.serviceId
        res <- UseFilesys.rm_file(filename)
    <- res

```

We simply wrapped the exposed facade interfaces with Aqua code and just pass through the returned IOResult data. Let's run our Aqua against the deployed service with familiar parameters:

```bash
# write to file
fluence run

```

All looks in order, well done! You now have the basic effector module for to write to hosts' filesystem, if permissioned, and a facade template to use.
