# Fluence console settings

Use the **Settings** page to manage your SSH and API keys and more.

## SSH Keys

On the **SSH keys** page, you can:
1. Create a new key of any of the RSA, ECDSA or ED25519 format.
2. Delete existing keys.

## API Keys

Instead of using the **Fluence Console**, you can manage your resources also through our **Public API**.

:::info
In the first stage of the **Alpha VM testing**, you will not have access to the **Public API**. The Fluence team will  notify you when this functionality becomes available.

On the API Keys page, users can:
1. Create a new API key. Currently, it is possible to specify `Permissions` and `Expiration time` separately.
2. Delete an API key.
