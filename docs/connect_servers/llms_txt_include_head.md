# Connect Servers

> Guides for data center operators who want to join the Fluence Network as compute providers. Providers connect bare-metal servers, earn USDC from customer workloads and FLT from capacity commitments.

Providers must operate Tier 3 or Tier 4 data centers and complete a KYB review before joining. All operations are managed through the [Fluence Provider Application](https://providers.fluence.network). Start with the [Overview](https://fluence.dev/docs/connect_servers/overview.md) for infrastructure and hardware requirements, then follow the guides in order: log in, add servers, create Kubernetes clusters, and configure IP subnets.
