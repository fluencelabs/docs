[Create first Web3 wallet with Metamask](https://support.metamask.io/start/getting-started-with-metamask/).

### Addresses Types Supported in Provider Application

- *Provider address* - the main  address that has full access to the core Fluence Marketplace smart-contracts in order to manage *Offers*, *Capacity commitments* and *Deals* contracts. Only this address has **exclusive access to the FLT and stablecoins rewards** earned from the Fluence Protocol.
- *Management address* - an additional "hot" wallet securely managed by the Fluence team on behlaf of the provider. It allows Provider application to execute limited scope of smart-contracts operations to automate the process of signing transactions within Fluence Application. The m*anagement address* **never has access to the Providersâ€™ rewards**, that are available only for *Provider address* private key holder.
