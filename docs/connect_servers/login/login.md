### Prerequisites

To be able to participate in the Fluence protocol, Fluence Network Providers need to control an EVM-compatible Web3 wallet and have a blockchain (Provider) address.

[Create your first Web3 wallet with Metamask](https://support.metamask.io/start/getting-started-with-metamask/).

### Addresses Types Supported in Provider Application

- *Provider address* - the wallet address that has full access to the core Fluence Marketplace smart-contracts in order to manage *Offers*, *Capacity commitments* and *Deals* contracts. Only this address has **exclusive access to the FLT and stablecoins rewards** earned from the Fluence Protocol.
- *Management address* - an additional "hot" wallet securely managed by the Fluence team on behalf of the provider. It allows the Provider Application to automate the process of signing transactions and execute limited smart-contracts operations. The *management address* **never has access to Provider rewards**, that are available only to the holder(s) of the private key of the *Provider address*.

:::info **Note**

Fully non-custodial smart-contracts interactions will be supported in the next release.
