# Marine CLI

The [Marine command line tool](https://github.com/fluencelabs/marine) provides the project `marine build` functionality, analogous to `cargo build`,  that results in the Rust code to be compiled to _wasm32-wasi_ modules. In addition,  `marine` provides utilities to inspect Wasm modules, expose Wasm module attributes or manually set module properties.

```sh
marine --help
```
