# Using wallets with Fluence web applications

## Introduction

In the Web3 world, authentication relies on a private/public key scheme—a more secure method than traditional password-based approaches. Web3 wallets offer a convenient way to manage these keys and prove identity when logging in or signing transactions.

Fluence applications, like most Web3 services, use wallet-based authentication. We've added support for most wallets on desktop and mobile platforms, so you can use your preferred crypto wallet with our services.

This guide will walk you through setting up your wallet and connecting to the Fluence Network.

We'll then explain how to connect to Fluence web applications using your chosen wallet.

All Fluence web services employ the same authentication method. While the examples in this guide focus on the Fluence Bridge application, the user experience is similar across other Fluence applications.

## Prepare your wallet

Before using Fluence web services, you must set up a compatible cryptocurrency wallet. This section will guide you through connecting your wallet to a Fluence web application and outline the supported wallet options.

You can connect with either desktop or mobile wallets — choose whichever you prefer!

:::tip

You should already have a cryptocurrency wallet. If you don't, we recommend creating one using [MetaMask's beginner guide](https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-metamask/)

### Supported wallets

Fluence authentication supports various wallet options through either direct app integration or WalletConnect. WalletConnect, an open-source protocol, enables a wide range of wallets to connect with decentralized applications (dApps) via QR codes or deep links.

#### Direct Connection Options

The following wallet applications are available to connect to Fluence services directly:

- Metamask
- Rainbow
- Coinbase Wallet

#### WalletConnect

If your preferred wallet isn't directly supported, you can use WalletConnect.

Through WalletConnect, you can use:

- All the wallets listed above
- Many other popular wallets, including Ledger, Binance Wallet, and Phantom

For a comprehensive list of supported wallets, visit the [WalletConnect Explorer](https://explorer.walletconnect.com/?type=wallet)

:::note

Further, Metamask is used as the examples' main wallet, but the actions shown are mostly the same for the other wallets.

### Import FLT tokens to your Ethereum wallet

:::note

You can skip this part if you have already added FLT tokens to your wallet, and they are displayed in the list of available assets.

:::

Initially, FLT tokens are not displayed in your wallet connected to the Ethereum network and must be added.

To display FLT tokens in your assets list (Metamask example is shown below):

1. User the address of the FLT token contract address: [0x236501327e701692a281934230AF0b6BE8Df3353](https://etherscan.io/token/0x236501327e701692a281934230AF0b6BE8Df3353)
1. Copy this string and open your wallet, find the **“Import tokens”** button, and press it
1. In the opened window, paste the token address to the input field and wait till the token symbol and the token decimal are loaded
1. Confirm the token addition and proceed
1. The token should appear in the list of your assets

:::note

### Add Fluence Network to your wallet

By default, your wallet does not include the Fluence network and token configuration. This section will show you how to add Fluence Network to your wallet with Chainlist or manually in your wallet.

#### Using Chainlist

You can add Fluence Network with Chainlist:

1.  Fluence can be found on Chainlist by this [link](https://chainlist.org/chain/9999999). Proceed to the site.
1.  Press **“Connect Wallet”** button.

### Connect with WalletConnect

If your preferred wallet isn't directly supported, you can use WalletConnect to link it to the Fluence Bridge. The actions are similar to the direct connection, but the process starts with a QR code scan.

1. Select WalletConnect from the list of available wallets.
1. A QR code will appear on your screen.
![Example of WalletConnect QR code](./assets/staking_app_wc.png)
1. Choose the app for authentication:

   - For mobile: open your preferred wallet app on the phone and scan the QR code displayed
   - For desktop: press the “Open” button under the QR. Choose the desktop app for authentication you prefer

   In this guide, **Metamask mobile app** is used as an example.

1. Open your mobile wallet app and look for a scan or WalletConnect option (usually in the settings or the main menu).
1. Use your wallet app to scan the QR code displayed on the Fluence Bridge website.
1. Your wallet app will ask for confirmation to connect. Approve the connection.
1. **Optional step:** If your wallet is connected to a different network, you will need to switch to the Fluence Mainnet first. The application will prompt you to switch the network. Confirm the switch.
