# Fluence NFT Marketplace User Guide

## About Fluence NFT Collection

Fluence NFTs are your gateway to staking on the Fluence Network, enabling FLT token holders to participate in our mission of global decentralized computing. These NFTs were initially distributed to winners of the first [FLT Stake Race](https://race.fluence.network/), with more to be released in future campaigns.
To participate in staking, you must either have been granted an NFT or purchased one from the newly launched [NFT Marketplace](https://nft.fluence.network/), where current NFT holders can list their tokens for sale.

:::note

Additional NFTs will be released to the winners of the next Stake Race campaign.

This guide will walk you through the Fluence NFT Marketplace, covering:

- An overview of the Marketplace interface
- Step-by-step instructions for buying an NFT
- Procedures for selling or transferring an NFT if you're already an owner

Whether you're looking to enter the Fluence ecosystem or manage your existing NFTs, this guide will provide you with the necessary information to navigate the Marketplace effectively.

### Prepare Your Wallet

Before using the Marketplace, it's essential to properly set up your crypto wallet for the Fluence Network. This preparation is crucial for interacting with all Fluence Web Applications. Your wallet should meet the following criteria:

1. The Fluence Network is added to your wallet's list of networks.
2. The FLT token is imported and visible in your wallet's token list.
3. You have FLT tokens _on the Fluence Network_. Since Fluence is an L2 Network, you must first bridge your FLT tokens from Ethereum to Fluence using the official [Bridge](https://bridge.fluence.network/bridge/fluence).

:::tip

For detailed instructions on wallet setup and token bridging, please refer to our comprehensive [Wallet Guide](../wallets_guide/wallets_guide.md) and [Bridge Guide](../bridge_guide/bridge_guide.md).

Only after your wallet is properly configured and connected to the Fluence Network can you interact with the Fluence NFT Marketplace to buy or sell Fluence NFTs.

**Note:** NFTs are sold and transferred on the Fluence Network. To be able to view the NFT in their wallet, the recipient must first add the Fluence Network. Read more on preparing the wallet to work with Fluence Network in the corresponding [guide](../wallets_guide/wallets_guide.md).

### Set NFT for sale

When you list an NFT for sale, and someone buys it, the funds are automatically transferred to your address. To sell an NFT, open the NFT card to be sold and follow these steps:

1.  Approve the Marketplace to manage all your NFTs - to transfer them automatically to a buyer; if you haven’t done it before - press the “Approve collection” button.

4.  Check that the listed NFT has the correct price.
5.  Wait for the NFT to be sold to someone. Once sold, you'll automatically receive your tokens.

:::note

Even if your NFT is set for sale, you still can transfer it manually without changing the “for sale” status. To do so, open its card and follow the steps described above in the “Transfer NFT” section.
