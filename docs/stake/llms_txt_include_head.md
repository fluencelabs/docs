# Stake

> Guides for FLT token holders who want to delegate stake on the Fluence Network and earn rewards. Stakers provide collateral that activates compute providers' capacity on the marketplace.

Start with the [Overview](https://fluence.dev/docs/stake/overview.md) to understand how staking works, including capacity commitments, rewards, vesting, and slashing. Then follow the guides in order: prepare your wallet, bridge funds from Ethereum to Fluence, and stake using either the Staking App (deposits of $12,000+ in FLT) or the Parasail staking pool (smaller deposits).
