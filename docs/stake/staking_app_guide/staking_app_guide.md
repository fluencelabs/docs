# Fluence Staking Application User Guide

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of becoming a staker in the Fluence Protocol, allowing you to earn rewards by contributing to the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN).
For that, you will use the Fluence Staking Application, a web application providing stakers with all the necessary resources to analyze available Capacity Commitments for staking and monitor active commitments' performance and rewards.

First, you'll be introduced to the Staking application â€” the main control panel for analyzing staking opportunities and monitoring the metrics of staked assets.
Then you will find a step-by-step guide on how to join the Fluence Network and stake your first Capacity Commitment.

If you are unfamiliar with the Fluence Network and the role of stakers, we recommend first reading the official [Key Concepts for Stakers](../overview.md#fluence-key-concepts-for-stakers). It explains the main concepts and mechanisms that are essential for understanding the staking process comprehensively.

:::note
Fluence is an L2 network, and to use your FLT and USDC tokens in the Fluence Network, you first have to bridge them from Ethereum. Read more on how to use the blockchain bridge in the [corresponding article](../bridge_guide/bridge_guide.md).
:::

## The staking application overview

:::note
Be cautious and use only the official application at [stake.fluence.network](https://stake.fluence.network). Never share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone, and always double-check the URL before signing the transactions.
:::

![The view of the main page of the Staking Application](./assets/app_view_main.png)
The view of the main page of the Staking Application

The Staking application consists of the following main parts:

- Top center: The navigation bar with links to the blockchain Bridge Application and Fluence NFT Collection on the Fluence Marketplace
- Top right: The button to connect your wallet to the application. Read more on how to connect your wallet to Fluence in this [article](../wallets_guide/wallets_guide.md)
- Panels with a summary of the activated Capacity Commitment performance:
  - **"Capacity commitments"** - distribution of activated CCs by statuses
  - **"Rewards"** - summary of rewards earned by CCs so far
- **Available for Staking:** List of Capacity Commitments available for staking
- **Staked Capacity Commitments:** Real-time information on the performance of active Capacity Commitments. If you are logged in, then the section will change to "**Your Capacity Commitments**"

:::info[**The page layout differs for authenticated and unauthenticated users:**]

Depending on whether you have logged in by connecting your wallet, the list of Capacity Commitments available for staking will remain the same.

But the information in the **Panels** and the **Staked Capacity Commitments** sections will be different:

- Without a connected wallet, you'll see all Capacity Commitments listed, allowing you to track and analyze overall Network performance and rewards
- When logged in with your wallet, you'll only see CCs you've activated, along with buttons to withdraw rewards and collateral

:::

The following sections will guide you through the application interface, demonstrate how to stake for a Capacity Commitment for the first time, and then monitor its performance.

### Capacity commitments statuses panel

![The view of the Capacity Commitments statuses panel](./assets/cc_status_panel.png)
The view of the Capacity Commitments statuses panel

This panel displays current information about the number of CCs in different states:

- `Funded`: CC is activated and awaits becoming active at the start of the next epoch
- `Active`: CC is operational, and its CUs are either submitting CC proofs or participating in Deals
- `Completed`: CC has successfully finished, but the staker hasn't yet withdrawn the collateral and rewards
- `Failed`: CC has failed, but the staker hasn't yet withdrawn the collateral and rewards
- `Removed`: Completed CCs from which the staker has withdrawn both collateral and rewards

#### The CC Lifecycle

After staking and activating a Capacity Commitment, it progresses through the following stages:

- It initially enters the `Funded` status
- In the subsequent epoch, the CC transitions to the `Active` status and begins participating in the Network
- Upon completion or failure, the CC remains in either the `Completed` or `Failed` status until the staker withdraws the collateral.
  The CC's Provider can start the collateral withdrawal process before the staker. This happens when the Provider unregisters the compute resources from the ended CC. In this case, the collateral is transferred to the staker's wallet.
- Finally, the CC transitions to the `Removed` status, when all rewards and collateral are withdrawn

### Capacity commitments rewards panel

![The view of the Capacity Commitments rewards panel](./assets/cc_rewards_panel.png)
The view of the Capacity Commitments rewards panel

This panel summarizes rewards earned in Capacity Commitments (CCs) across the Network or activated by the user. Rewards accumulate each epoch and vest over time.

Rewards can have the following statuses:

- `In vesting`: Earned rewards that are locked and will be vested later
- `Available to claim`: Rewards that can be withdrawn immediately
- `Claimed`: Rewards already withdrawn from the CC. Both the CC's Provider and staker can initiate the withdrawal process. If the Provider initiates withdrawal first, rewards will be automatically sent to the staker's wallet

:::note

For logged-in users, the panel displays a button to withdraw all available rewards from all CCs.

:::

### Available for the Staking section

In this section, you'll find the list of Capacity Commitments available for staking.

![The view of the Available for staking section](./assets/available_for_staking_view.png)
The view of the Available for staking section

This section has the following components:

- A list of CCs available for staking, with each CC displayed as an expandable card
- Search bar: You can filter the list of Capacity Commitments by entering either:
  - Capacity Commitment ID
  - Provider name
- For users with a connected wallet, an "only for me" toggle is available. This filter displays CCs where Providers have set your wallet address as the only possible staker

#### Capacity Commitment cards list fields

![The view of the available for staking Capacity Commitment cards collapsed](./assets/available_for_staking_collapsed_cards.png)

Clicking on an individual CC card expands it, revealing more detailed information about the Capacity Commitment and the Provider. This expanded view also allows you to stake for the CC.

**Commitment Information:**

- `Created at`: The date when the Provider created the CC
- `Peer ID`: The identifier of the Peer you're staking for. Find more information about this Peer in the CC explorer: explorer.fluence.dev/peer/`<Peer ID>`
- `Compute Capacity`: The number of Compute Units participating in the CC. For more details on how Fluence measures compute resources, refer to the "Key concepts" section above

**Provider Information:**

- `Provider lifetime`: The duration since the Provider registered in the Network
- `Total CCs over time`: The number of CCs the Provider has created to date. For detailed information about the Provider's published CCs and their status, visit the Provider's page in the Explorer: [https://explorer.fluence.dev/provider/](https://explorer.fluence.dev/provider/)`<Provider id>`/capacity

#### Stake button view

The **"Stake"** button view depends on whether you have authenticated by connecting your wallet to the web application and have an NFT that grants you the right to stake tokens for Capacity Commitments:

- If you haven't connected your wallet to the application yet, you'll see a **"Connect wallet"** button.
![The Stake button view for unauthenticated users](./assets/stake_button_unauth.png)

- If you've connected your wallet but don't have a Fluence NFT, you'll see an "NFT required" button with an information message below it. Read more about Fluence NFTs and how to get one in the corresponding guide.
![The Stake button view for authenticated users without Fluence NFT](./assets/stake_button_nft.png)

- If you've connected your wallet and have a Fluence NFT, you're free to stake to any CC you like.
  However, if a provider has set exclusive staking rights for another address, the "Stake" button will be inactive. In that case, you need to choose another CC for staking.
![The Stake button view for authenticated users with a Fluence NFT, who cannot stake because the CC's provider has set exclusive staking rights for another address](./assets/stake_button_reserved.png)

- If you've connected your wallet and have a Fluence NFT, you're free to stake to any CC you like. In an individual CC card, a "Stake" button will be active. Read more about how to choose a CC for staking in the section below.

- When logged in with your wallet, you'll only see CCs you've activated, along with buttons to withdraw rewards and collateral

:::

#### Individual CC card general information fields

In the collapsed state, each card shows the following general information about a CC:

- `Capacity Commitment ID`: A unique identifier for the CC, with a hyperlink to the Fluence Explorer. This link provides detailed information about the CC, including a list of its Compute Units (CUs)
- `Provider name`: The name set by the Provider for public display. You can use this name to identify the Provider and find more information in both the Staking Application and [Fluence Explorer](https://explorer.fluence.dev/)
- `Expiration`: The period during which the CC will remain active and earn rewards unless it fails earlier
- `Staking reward`: The share of rewards the staker earns for Capacity Commitment activity
- `Status`: The current status of the CC

#### Individual CC card data fields

Current CC rewards information mirrors the fields in the total capacity commitments rewards panel. If you're logged in and have staked for the CC, you can withdraw available rewards.

## How to Stake for a Capacity Commitment with the Staking Application

This section provides a step-by-step guide to staking for Capacity Commitments in the Fluence Staking Application.

### Prepare Your Wallet

You'll first need to connect a compatible crypto wallet to use the Staking Application. This section will guide you through ensuring your wallet is ready for use with the Staking Application.

:::tip

Read the comprehensive [guide](../wallets_guide/wallets_guide.md) on using crypto wallets with Fluence web applications.

:::

To ensure your wallet is ready for the Staking Application, verify the following:

1. Your wallet is compatible with Fluence authentication methods.
1. You've added the Fluence Network to your wallet's list of networks.
1. You've imported the FLT token, and it's visible in your wallet's token list.
1. You have FLT tokens _in the Fluence Network_. As Fluence is an L2 Network, you must first bridge your FLT tokens from Ethereum to Fluence using the official Bridge. Click "Bridge" in the top center navigation bar to access the Bridge.
1. You have a Fluence NFT that grants you the right to stake for Capacity Commitments. You can obtain an NFT on the official [Marketplace](https://nft.fluence.network/).

Once your wallet is connected to Fluence, it's time to choose the Capacity Commitment to stake for!

### Find the CC that meets your requirements

To find a CC that matches your requirements, let's review the most important criteria:

- **Expected APR and staking rate:** These values determine your potential rewards. A low staking rate means the Provider shares fewer rewards, but this is relative. A high-performance Compute Peer with a low rate might still outperform a smaller peer with a high rate.
- **Duration:** This is the period your funds will be staked for, if they do not fail earlier because the collateral slashing threshold has been reached. Shorter terms allow quicker fund retrieval and re-staking, while longer terms yield higher rewards.
- **Provider reputation:** Use the Staking Application and Fluence Explorer to assess provider performance.

### Stake

After you've found the CC(s) you want to stake on, it's time to delegate your FLT tokens:

1.  Expand the target CC's card by clicking it
1.  Ensure you're eligible to stake: your wallet is connected to the application, and you own a Fluence NFT in that wallet
1.  Click the **"Stake"** button
![The view of a card of CC available for staking.](./assets/stake_view_of_card_for_staking.png)

1.  Confirm that you agree with the staking terms in the popped-up window
![The view of a confirmation window for staking.](./assets/stake_confirm_depo_app_view.png)

1.  Sign the transaction in your wallet
![The view of a transaction signing window in the wallet](./assets/stake_sign_tx.png)

1.  A message informing about a successful staking will pop up. This message has the link to the transaction in the block explorer under the "Tx: â€¦" text
![The view of a successful staking confirmation message](./assets/stake_confirmed_depo_view.png)

1.  You can proceed to the "**Your Capacity Commitments**" section under the list of available for staking CCs section and monitor the status and performance of the staked CC, or stay on this page and choose other CCs for staking

:::info

If someone else has staked a CC before you while you were sending the transaction, or if the transaction has reverted, you will see a message informing you of this!

:::

## How to withdraw rewards

:::info
A Capacity Commitment provider is eligible to initiate the rewards withdrawal process before a staker. In this case, the rewards are automatically transferred to the staker wallet, and the process described below is skipped.
:::

To withdraw rewards, log in to the application using the wallet address you used to activate Capacity Commitments.

The Rewards panel will then display your rewards' current status. "Available to claim" shows the rewards that have been unlocked and are ready to be claimed.

![The view of the rewards panel with available rewards to withdraw](./assets/withdraw_rew_panel_view.png)

### Withdraw rewards from an individual CC

If you want to withdraw rewards from a CC where they are available, do the following:

1.  Find the CC in the list and click its card to expand it
![The view of a card of a CC available for rewards withdrawal](./assets/card_for_withdraw_view.png)

1.  Click the **"withdraw rewards"** button
1.  Confirm the withdrawal in the popped-up window
![The view of a confirmation window for rewards withdrawal](./assets/withdraw_rew_card_confirm_in_app.png)

1.  Confirm the transaction in your wallet. Notice that the information window in the Staking Application contains the ID of commitment you are withdrawing from
![The view of a transaction signing window in the wallet](./assets/withdraw_rew_card_confirm_in_wallet.png)

1.  An information message confirming the successful withdrawal will pop up
![The view of a successful rewards withdrawal confirmation message](./assets/withdraw_rew_one_cards_success.png)

1.  Ensure that the correct amount of rewards has been transferred to your account and that in the individual CC card:
    - The amount of rewards available to claim has reduced (to zero or a smaller positive value if, during the withdrawal, a new reward was vested)
    - The total claimed value has increased by the amount of rewards withdrawn.

### Withdraw all available rewards

If you want to withdraw rewards from only one CC where they are available, do the following:

1.  Click the **"Withdraw available rewards"** button in the top right panel "Rewards."
1.  Confirm the withdrawal in the popped-up window
![The view of a confirmation window for rewards withdrawal](./assets/withdr_rew_all_confirm_app.png)

1.  Confirm the transaction in your wallet. Notice that the information window in the Staking Application contains the number of commitments you are withdrawing from
![The view of a transaction signing window in the wallet](./assets/withdr_rew_all_confirm_wallet.png)

1.  An information message confirming the successful withdrawal will pop up
![The view of a successful rewards withdrawal confirmation message](./assets/withdr_rew_all_success.png)

1.  Ensure that the correct amount of rewards has been transferred to your account and that in the rewards panel:

    - The amount of rewards available to claim has reduced (to zero or a smaller positive value if, during the withdrawal, a new reward was vested)
    - The total claimed amount value has increased by the amount of rewards withdrawn
    ![The view of a panel with all rewards withdrawn](./assets/panel_all_rewards_withdrawn.png)

### How to withdraw collateral

:::info
The Capacity Commitment provider is eligible to initiate the collateral withdrawal process before the staker removes its Compute Units from the ended CC. In this case, the collateral is automatically transferred to the staker's wallet, and the process described below is skipped.
:::

A staker can withdraw their collateral from a CC once it has completed or failed. The process for withdrawing collateral is essentially the same for completed and failed Capacity Commitments.

However, there's one crucial difference: _Failed CCs have a cooldown period_, during which stakers cannot withdraw collateral. In such cases, the withdrawal button won't appear in the interface until the cooldown period has passed.

:::note[**Important numbers**]

The cooldown period for withdrawing collateral from a **Failed CC** **now** is **0 epochs** - instant withdrawal is available.
In the **future**, it will be set to **30 days**, during which stakers cannot withdraw collateral.

:::

To withdraw collateral from a Capacity Commitment, do the following:

1.  Find the CC in the list and click its card to expand it
![The view of a card of a CC available for collateral withdrawal](./assets/withdraw_collateral_cc_card_view.png)
1.  Click the **"withdraw collateral"** button
1.  Confirm the withdrawal in the popped-up window
![The view of a confirmation window for collateral withdrawal](./assets/withdraw_collateral_confirm.png)
1.  Confirm the transaction in your wallet
1.  An information message confirming the successful withdrawal will pop up
![The view of a successful collateral withdrawal confirmation message](./assets/withdraw_collateral_success.png)
1.  Ensure that the correct amount of tokens has been transferred to your account and that in the individual CC card:

    - The current collateral field now has 0 tokens available.
    - The "withdraw collateral" button is replaced with an "already withdrawn" caption.
    - The status field in the card now displays "withdrawn".
    ![The view of a card of a CC after collateral withdrawal](./assets/withdraw_collateral_card_after_view.png)
