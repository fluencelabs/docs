## How to become a Staker on Fluence Network

Becoming a Staker on the Fluence Network is a simple process and may vary depending on the deposit size and the level of involvement you want to have in the network.

- **Key Concepts**: It is recommended to read the [Key Concepts for Stakers](./key_concepts_staker.md) first to understand the basics of the Fluence Network.
- **Prepare your wallet**: To interact with the Fluence Network, you need to prepare your crypto wallet or create one. Read the comprehensive [guide](./wallets_guide/wallets_guide.md) on using crypto wallets with Fluence web applications.
- **Bridge Funds to Fluence**: Fluence is an L2 network, and to use your FLT and USDC tokens in the Fluence network, you first have to bridge them from Ethereum. Read the [guide](./bridge_guide/bridge_guide.md) on how to bridge your funds with the Fluence Bridge App.
- **Obtain an NFT**: Access to staking is enabled by Fluence NFTs, which can purchased or sold on the official Fluence [NFT Marketplace](https://nft.fluence.network/). Read the official [guide](./nft_guide/nft_guide.md) on how to obtain an NFT.
- **Stake**: You can stake your FLT tokens to the Fluence Network differently depending on the deposit size and the level of involvement you want to have in the network:
  - **The Fluence Staking App**: use the official [Staking App](https://staking.fluence.network/) to stake for Capacity Commitments. Read the official [guide](./staking_app_guide/staking_app_guide.md) to find more.
  - **Staking Pool**: If your deposit is not large enough to stake for a Capacity Commitment directly, or you want to abstract most of the staking process - you can join a Staking Pool. The Pool is created in partnership with a re-staking protocol [Parasail](https://www.parasail.network). Simply head to [Fluenceâ€™s Delegation Pool](https://www.parasail.network/delegate/fluence) on Parasail, and start delegating your tokens.
